# MarkovChains
The Markov Chain Text Generator is a Java application that leverages the principles of Markov chains to generate text. By analyzing a source text, it learns the probability of a word following another and uses this knowledge to create new, plausible sequences of words. This project is an excellent demonstration of basic natural language processing (NLP) concepts and probabilistic models.

Features
Text Learning: Trains the model using any text file, learning the sequence and probability of words.
Text Generation: Generates new text based on the learned model, with the user specifying the desired word count.
Customizable Source Text: Allows the user to input any text file for the model to learn from, making the generated text as versatile and varied as desired.
Simple User Interface: Utilizes the console for all user interactions, making it easy to use and accessible.
